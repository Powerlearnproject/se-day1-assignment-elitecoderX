### **Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering**

1. **Definition and Importance**  
   Software engineering is the application of engineering principles to design, develop, test, and maintain software systems. It's crucial in the tech industry for building reliable, scalable, and efficient software solutions.

2. **Key Milestones**  
   - **1968 NATO Conference**: Coined the term "software engineering" to address the software crisis.  
   - **Introduction of the Waterfall Model (1970s)**: A structured approach to software development.  
   - **Agile Manifesto (2001)**: Shifted focus to iterative, customer-centric development.

3. **Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**  
   - **Requirement Analysis**  
   - **Design**  
   - **Implementation (Coding)**  
   - **Testing**  
   - **Deployment**  
   - **Maintenance**

4. **Waterfall vs Agile**  
   - **Waterfall**: Linear, sequential. Ideal for projects with clear, fixed requirements (e.g., compliance software).  
   - **Agile**: Iterative, flexible. Suitable for dynamic environments (e.g., mobile app development).

5. **Roles in a Software Team**  
   - **Software Developer**: Writes and maintains code.  
   - **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer**: Tests software to ensure it meets quality standards.  
   - **Project Manager**: Plans, monitors progress, coordinates between stakeholders.

6. **Importance of IDEs and VCS**  
   - **IDEs**: Offer tools for efficient coding (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ).  
   - **VCS**: Manage code versions and collaboration (e.g., Git, GitHub).

7. **Common Challenges and Strategies**  
   - **Challenge**: Scope creep → **Strategy**: Clear requirement documentation.  
   - **Challenge**: Debugging complex code → **Strategy**: Modular design and logging.  
   - **Challenge**: Team communication → **Strategy**: Daily stand-ups and clear documentation.

8. **Types of Testing**  
   - **Unit Testing**: Tests individual functions.  
   - **Integration Testing**: Tests interaction between modules.  
   - **System Testing**: Tests the complete system.  
   - **Acceptance Testing**: Ensures it meets user requirements.

### **Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering**

1. **Prompt Engineering Definition**  
   Prompt engineering is crafting inputs (prompts) to effectively communicate with AI models and obtain desired outputs. It's vital for guiding AI behavior.

2. **Example of Prompt Improvement**  
   - **Vague Prompt**: "Tell me about Python."  
   - **Improved Prompt**: "Give me a brief overview of Python programming, including its main features and typical use cases."  
   - **Why Effective**: It's specific, sets scope, and helps the AI provide relevant, structured information.
